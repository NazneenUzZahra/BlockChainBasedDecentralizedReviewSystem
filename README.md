# Block Chain Based Decentralized ReviewSystem
This project is based on an online review based decentralized system. It consist of Ethereum,
Blockchain, Smart contracts and IPFS(Inter Planetary File System). The purpose of this Blochian
based review system is to make the traditional online review system into decentralized, trusted
online review with the ability of tracking and tracing reviews to the original reviewers. This
system incentivizes reviewers with Ether to provide their review. Service providers have the
ability to assign tokens to reviewer in order to validate their reviews. This system also presents
construction of system and its architecture related to front-end and back-end interfaces used
by actors, itâ€™s also tested for security and vulnerability of Ethereum smart code.
